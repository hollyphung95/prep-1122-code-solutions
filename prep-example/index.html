    With my new coding skills, I'd like to start with building an website and or app for my boyfriend's Pokemon Card shop
 to help promote our sales and organize information on Pokemon. <br>In the future, Id like to continue working with similar card/gaming apps/websites
 to further promote our love for cards and collectibles.
